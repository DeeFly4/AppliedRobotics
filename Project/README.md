# Dynamixel project

This project uses Dynamixel servos and [this library](https://gitlab.control.lth.se/anders_blomdell/dynamixel) to control them. The library requires Linux. If running on PC you need to use WSL. Install the library by cloning the repo onto your machine, navigating into the directory and then running:

```console
python setup.py
```

You might have to use an older version of Python to ensure compatibility.
